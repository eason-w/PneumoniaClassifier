# PneumoniaClassifier
My project on classifying pneumonia with FastAI. 

As you can see, there are 2 Jupyter notebooks.
One of them is a classifier that distinguishes between viral and bacterial pneumonia and also healthy lungs and I acheieved ~85% accuracy.
The second one is a classifier that only distinguishes between lungs with pneumonia and healthy lungs and I achieved an accuracy of ~99.5% accuracy.

The notebooks were coded in FastAI.
